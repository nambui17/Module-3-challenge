# Generate Password

## Description

This webpage is designed to generate a password between the lengths of 8 and 128 characters. The website is a refactor of existing code to add the generating password functionality to the Generate Password button. The generate password button will ask for prompts to determine which character types to add (lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters). The webpage allows for a secure password to be generated. In the process of creating the functionality for the webpage, Javascript loops, functions, and syntax was practiced

## Usage

To use the Generate Password button, click on the red button.
1. A window will appear asking for the user to enter a number between 8 and 128. Enter a number on the keyboard between 8 and 128. If the number is not between those values, then an error message will alert and ask the user to enter a valid number.
2. After entering the length of the password desired, a series of confirmation prompts will appear asking the user to include lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, or special characters in the password, in that order.
3. If no options are selected for the character types, then the button will generate a password of only lowercase letters by default.
4. The generated password will appear in the center box with dashed lines once the password has been generated.
